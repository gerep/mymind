# my mind

This is a CLI that uses AI to read the image or text and generate relevant tags.
The data will be saved in a markdown format so it can be visualised with Obsidian.

The AI service will use a free-tier, probably `Gemini 3 Flash API` (which has a very generous free tier)

## TODO:

- make it a cli: `mymind [link]` or `mymind [note]`
- use an AI service to read the content (text/image) and create relevant nodes
- store the details in a markdown format so I can see it in Obsidian.
